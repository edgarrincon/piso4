This project is one of the most creative I have ever worked on.

The advertising company is called "piso4" which means the 4th floor of a building, so the creative team asked me if we could make a landing page simulating an elevator using react.

I was delighted with the idea, and I presented the prototype of how I would do it, my lack of time prevented me from finishing the project but I really liked working with them.
